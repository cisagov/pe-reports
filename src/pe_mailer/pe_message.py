The attached Posture and Exposure (P&E) report is the result of a CISA Cyber Assessments service that provides actionable information about public exposures and security posture weaknesses.

All of the findings and information are derived from public information that is currently available. No scanning has occurred for this service.

The report will initially be delivered twice per month, but it will be updated and enhanced to integrate more data sources and be sent with greater frequency in the future. The P&E report is for your situational awareness as a supplement to other threat reports you may have internally or externally. No action is required, but your feedback and questions are more than welcome.

Note: The report is encrypted with your Cyber Hygiene password.

Thank you,
