# Ignore flake8's default warning about maximum line length, which has
# a hard stop at the configured value.  Instead we use
# flake8-bugbear's B950, which allows up to 10% overage.
#
# Also ignore flake8's warning about line breaks before binary
# operators.  It no longer agrees with PEP8.  See, for example, here:
# https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/21. Guido agrees here:
# https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b.
#
# Also ignore flake8's error about whitespaces before a ':'. (E203)
# No longer complies with PEP8 See example, here:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373
